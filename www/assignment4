  <h3>About the Site</h3>
  <div id="introduction to site">
    <p>I've spent <em>a lot</em> of time cooking and need somewhere to put all the things I've learned, come across, and enjoyed. This will be a hodgepodge of everything I come across food wise. I hope you enjoy! This site is for anyone who interacts with
      food, so that means everyone! Ideally you want to eat good food, because while we do have to eat why not eat delicious food. Sure, food is fuel, but with a little effort food also gets to taste amazing!</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div id="introduction to creator">
    <p>Currently I am an undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Information Technology and will go into a master's degree in Library and Information Sciences after. While libraries are what I want to spend my life's working doing - food and cooking are
      one of, if not, my greatest passions in life. Food represents a universal truth in everyone's existance; we all have to eat. It is deeply engrained within our society as a way to connect with are given and chosen families. Food is how I show my
      love for others, if I'm willing to make you a meal, dessert, or share food with you it definitely means I like you. Or at the very least tolerate your presence ;). Given that we all have to eat, why not eat well and enjoy it.<br><br>Basically my goal in life is to be <a href="https://barefootcontessa.com/about" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a> without any<a href="https://wearemitu.com/culture/latino-twitter-is-dragging-food-network-star-for-her-white-washed-pozole-recipe/" target="_blank"> cultural appropriation</a>.</p>
