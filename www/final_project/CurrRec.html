            <h3>Ad Hoc Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
          </div>
          <span>Chocolate chip cookies are a classic and for good reason. They smell glorious while baking, the oven warms your house and they're delicious.
          I've tried many recipes over the years, but this one has stuck around.</span><br><br>

          <p>   We all love chocolate chip cookies, right? There are few who don't and while they're allowed their opinion, they should probably try this cookie.
          Way back to Christmas 2015 my partner gifted me a copy of Thomas Keller's <em>Ad Hoc at Home</em> cookbook. For my 25th birthday earlier that year
          he had surprised me with a trip to Yountville to visit the restaurant and I had become smitten. The first recipe I made was the chocolate chip cookie recipe.
          This is that recipe.</p>
          <p> I have not made many changes to this recipe, because truly it's beautiful in it's simplicity of ingredients. Keller uses top-notch ingredients that shine
          through the cookie, but ultimately you use what's on hand. I decided my first time making these to substitute the called for good Valhrona chocolate for a favorite Bay Area
          chocolate, Tcho.</p>
          <p> Where I was living at the time, I didn't have access to Valhrona but I had one of the arguably best Tcho bars on hand, the Moccachino. It has a perfect
          balance of coffee and chocolate so I used it and a mix of regular and mini sized chocolate chips. I couldn't be happier with how they turned out. The original recipe also notes to sift the chopped chocolate
          to remove any small flakes and dust as a way to keep the distinction between the dough and the chocolate. I've never done it and probably never will as I love how the cookie
          seams wonderfully studded and tinted by chocolate throughout.</p>
          <p> If you're one for baking and have made other recipes, this one will make sense. However you will notice the absence of vanilla in the recipe. When first making
          these I figured it had to be a mistake, but I followed it through and it's not missed. I baked these for a professor and I asked how they liked them, their
          response was that they tasted cleaner, less muttled - that's the lack of vanilla. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.</p>

          <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>2 1/3 cups plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
              <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
              <li>1 bar (2.5 ounces) Tcho Moccachino bar chopped into small squares and bits</li>
              <li>7.5 ounces (roughly 1 1/2 cups) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
              <li>1/2 pound (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
              <li>1 cup packed dark brown sugar - this can be light brown sugar, but dark brown sugar will produce a deeper taste</li>
              <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
              <li>2 large eggs</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="directions">
            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Postion oven racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven and preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line two baking sheets with Silpats or parchement paper.</li>
              <li>Sift the flour and baking soda into a medium bowl. Stir in the salt.</li>
              <li>If chosen to do so, put chopped chocolate in a fine-mesh strainer and shake to remove chocolate "dust" (small fragements).</li>
              <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle, beat half the butter on medium speed until fairly smooth.</li>
              <li>Add both sugars and the remaining butter, and beat until well combined, then beat for a few minutes, until mixture is light and creamy.
              Scrape down sides of the bowl.</li>
              <li>Add eggs one at a time, beating until the first one is incorporated before adding the next and scraping the bowl as necessary.</li>
              <li>Add dry ingredients and mix on low speed to combine. Mix in chocolate.</li>
              <li>Remove bowl from mixer and fold dough with a spatula to be sure the chocolate is evenly incorporated.</li>
              <li>Using about 2 level tablespoons per cookie, shape dough into balls. Arrange 8 cookies on each pan, leaving about 2 inches between them,
              because the dough will spread.</li>
              <li>Bake for 12 minutes, or until the tops are no longer shiny, switching the position and rotating pans halfway through baking.</li>
              <li>Cool cookies on the pans on cooling racks for about 2 minutes to firm up a bit, then transfer to the racks to cool completely.
              Repeat with second batch of cookies.</li>
            </ol>

                  <li>The dough or shaped cookies can be refrigerated, well wrapped, for up to 5 days or frozen for 2 weeks.
                  Freeze shaped cookies on the baking sheets until firm, then transfer to freezer containers. Defrost frozen cookies overnight in the refrigerator before baking.</li>
