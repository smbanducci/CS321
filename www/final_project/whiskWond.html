      <h3>About the Site</h3>
        <div class="recpSite">
          I've spent <em>a lot</em> of time cooking and need somewhere to put all the things I've learned, come across, and enjoyed. This will be a hodgepodge of everything pertaining to food in my life and is intended for anyone who interacts with
          food, so that means everyone! Ideally you want to eat good food, because while we do have to eat why not eat delicious food.
          <p></p>
          Sure, food is fuel, but with a little effort food also gets to taste amazing. I hope you enjoy!

      <h3>About Me</h3>
        <img class="author_img" src= "css/images/website_self_img.png" alt="author image">
        <div class="recpSite">
          Currently I am an undergrad pursuing a degree in Information Technology and will go into a master's degree in Library and Information Sciences after. While libraries are what I want to spend my life's working doing - food and cooking are
          one of, if not, my greatest passions in life. Food represents a universal truth in everyone's existence; we all have to eat. It is deeply engrained within our society as a way to connect with our given and chosen families. Food is how I show my
          love for others. If I'm willing to make you a meal, dessert, or share food with you it definitely means I like you.
          <p></p>
          Basically my goal in life is to be <a href="https://barefootcontessa.com/about" target="_blank">Ina Garten</a> without any<a href="https://wearemitu.com/culture/latino-twitter-is-dragging-food-network-star-for-her-white-washed-pozole-recipe/" target="_blank"> cultural appropriation</a>.
